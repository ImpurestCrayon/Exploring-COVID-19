Hello, my name is Ian. This is My exploration of some data evolving around COVID-19.

Key Questions:
1. How has media attention surrounding COVID-19 changed in volume in relation to the spread of the disease?

        a) Between Dec/2019 – March/2020 how did metrics on US reporting on COVID-19 match the actual number of confirmed cases both worldwide and inside the US?
        b) Was there a specific point in time where the reporting became more negative or positive in tone, and does that correlate with any specific major event or policy change?

2. How has China and the Chinese reaction to the pandemic been percieved in general terms since the outbreak of the pandemic?

        a)Are there specific media outlets, popular blog sites or other sources of digital information that appear to be wholly positive or negative against China, and if so how have they changed, it at all, over Dec/2019 to March/2020 time frame?
        b)What specific media outlets, popular blog sites or other sources of digital information are supporting Chinese narratives surrounding the pandemic?
        
            i.Do you see any connection in terms of time or network between these outlets?
            ii.How popular or unpopular have these outlets proven during the outbreak is the Chinese narrative spreading or being adopted effectively, and has this changed over time?

3. Is there an observable pattern beyond population density for the spread of COVID-19?

        a)Is there a link between cities with direct flights to China and outbreaks?
        b)Did temperature, or coastal proximity appear to influence pandemic spread?
